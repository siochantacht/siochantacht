### Sally Stuike, MACP

I am a client-focused, strengths-based therapist who works with people who have experienced trauma. As a trauma counsellor, I work with clients in a gentle and compassionate way to identify actions, reactions, and behaviours that once served them but are now impacting their lives. I believe that every person has the ability to create a life that they want and need, and I work with clients to feel empowered to build their best life.

I use a holistic approach when working with clients, supporting them in mind, body, and spirit. I understand how trauma impacts the mind and the body, and I use somatic and movement therapy to help people connect with themselves again. I use a wide range of therapies, tools, and techniques that help each client create their unique path towards healing.

My background includes working with people who have experienced sexual violence, and I am the lead counsellor for a weekly group for survivors of sexual violence. I have worked with people who have been in the sex trade, people with addictions, and people who have experienced domestic violence. I bring a culturally competent and feminist approach to my practice, supporting people as they process their past and navigate the future they desire.

I have received my Masters of Arts and Counselling Psychology and am a provisional Registered Clinical Counsellor based in Duncan.
